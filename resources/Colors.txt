When choosing colors to signify different booking statuses, it's important to choose colors that are intuitive, easily distinguishable, and aligned with common color conventions used in UI design. Here’s a set of color suggestions for each booking status:

1. Pending
Color: Light Yellow or Amber
Hex: #FFEB3B or #FFC107
Reason: Yellow is often associated with something awaiting attention, signaling a process that is in progress but not yet complete.
2. Denied
Color: Red or Light Red
Hex: #F44336 or #FFCDD2
Reason: Red universally signifies rejection, danger, or something being disapproved. It's a strong visual cue to indicate an issue.
3. Approved
Color: Green
Hex: #4CAF50 or #81C784
Reason: Green is commonly associated with success, approval, or go-ahead actions. It’s a clear signal of a positive outcome.
4. Confirmed
Color: Blue
Hex: #2196F3 or #64B5F6
Reason: Blue typically signifies certainty, security, and finality. It's commonly used to indicate that something is officially confirmed or locked in.
5. Rescheduled
Color: Orange
Hex: #FF9800 or #FFB74D
Reason: Orange can indicate change or action. It stands out as a “neutral” but still urgent color, signifying a change without being as alarming as red.
6. Re: Pending
Color: Light Blue or Cyan
Hex: #00BCD4 or #B2EBF2
Reason: Light blue or cyan suggests a state that is still in process, but with an implied follow-up or update. It can signal that the request is back in a waiting or uncertain state.
7. Re: Approved
Color: Light Green or Lime
Hex: #8BC34A or #C5E1A5
Reason: A softer green indicates that approval has been revisited or renewed. It conveys that the action has been reconsidered and granted again.
8. Re: Confirmed
Color: Darker Blue or Teal
Hex: #1976D2 or #00796B
Reason: A deeper blue or teal can signal that the confirmation has been revisited or reaffirmed, but with more emphasis on certainty compared to initial confirmation.

Notes:
Accessibility: When selecting colors for status indicators, ensure good contrast and accessibility, especially for colorblind users. You may want to consider adding text labels or icons to further clarify the status.
Consistency: Use consistent color choices throughout your system to avoid confusion. Colors should convey the same meaning in all instances where they are used.
If you plan to implement these in a web interface, it's always a good idea to test for visibility and accessibility across various devices and lighting conditions.
