				<p>Mauban, home of Cagbalete, was initially  composed  of  five  small  settlements  known  as  Cagsiay,
					Daungang Dumagat,  Pinagbayanan,  Luya-luya  and  Tubog.   Daungang  Dumagat
					was  led  by  Gat Pagil,  a  Dumagat.  It   was  then  situated  at  what  
					today  is  the  pier  area.  On  the  other hand,  Pinagbayanan  that  was  
					located  at  the  side  of  Maapon  River  was  the  seat  of government  among 
					the  Tagalogs  led  by  Luis  Bernardo.  Both  communities  were  always subjected 
					to  raids  of  Moros  though  Daungang  Dumagat  through  their  great  warrior
					and leader  had  always  felt  a  sense  of  security.
